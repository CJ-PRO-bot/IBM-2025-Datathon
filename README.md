## HeeboAI - "Community-Driven Solution to Tackle Waste Problem"

## Project Description:
We are building HeeboAI, an AI-verified community waste reporting system, to fix the real bottleneck in clean-up drives: trusted proof and quick response. Unmanaged dumps fuel methane emissions and harm land and water, and genuine citizen efforts are buried by fake, old, or duplicate photos and slow manual reviews. Our theory of change is simple: if reporting is phone-simple (“see waste → snap → submit”), if AI verifies evidence in seconds, and if verified actions are publicly recognized, then communities will clean more, officials will respond faster, and policy will improve with reliable data. The product has three user-facing parts—a lightweight reporter app that captures EXIF and uploads photos; a verifier service that checks EXIF plausibility, de-duplicates with perceptual hashes, and classifies validity (our baseline reached ~83% accuracy with dirty-class recall ≈0.89); and an admin console that auto-triages cases into “Action Now” or “Re-check,” shows hotspot maps and SLAs, and produces audit-ready evidence bundles. Recognition features will motivate students and citizens while a public impact map turns verified photos into a shared story of progress. 
In short, HeeboAI is a trust engine for civic cleanliness that turns every verified photo into measurable action, bridging community indivduals with admins through our AI system, leveraging public phones for visibilty, ensuring faster municipal response, and visible recognition—scaling local effort into national impact.

## Problem Statement
Waste Pollution is Fueling Climate Change. Unmanaged waste dumps emit methane and greenhouse gases, accelerating global warming. Plastic and toxic waste enter soil and water, damaging farmland and reducing crop quality. Communities lack efficient systems to monitor or prevent illegal dumping, making the crisis invisible. Manual waste reporting is slow, unreliable, and easy to fake — people can upload unrelated or old photos. Installing cameras or placing officials everywhere isn’t feasible, making areas prone to waste hotspots and land degradation. Without proper verification, resources are wasted, and data collected by programs is inaccurate. This leads to poor policy decisions and demotivates genuine volunteers who aren’t fairly recognized. Thousands of students, citizens, and volunteers contribute weekly to keep communities clean. But without proof or recognition, their real impact remains invisible and unrewarded. The absence of acknowledgment leads to low motivation and declining participation in environmental drives. Communities have no unified digital platform to see who’s contributing or which areas need cleanup. Admins struggle to track activities, making large-scale waste programs inefficient and unaccountable. Without visibility, collective ownership and civic pride in maintaining cleanliness remain low. Good initiatives fail because genuine actions aren’t verified or celebrated. Waste continues to pile up, hurting climate, health, and local agriculture. We lose the chance to transform simple local actions into a national movement for sustainability.

#### “Fake reports, lost recognition, and untracked waste activities weaken our fight against climate change — while real volunteers remain unseen.”

As shown in the flow chart, admin priortize valid photos, checking the authentic ones, and then the recheck_photos saving time and energy, while ensuring immediate response to the authenticated reports. 

## Solution Statement
Everyone has a phone, so reporting is "see waste → snap → submit." Anyone — students, farmers, citizens — can simply snap and upload a photo from their phone. The app’s AI instantly verifies authenticity, detecting if the image truly shows a cleanup or waste site. No special training or equipment needed — just a camera and a few seconds. AI automatically filters fake, old, or duplicate images using metadata, image hashes, and visual features. Genuine efforts get approved in real-time, while suspicious ones are flagged for recheck. Behind that simple flow, an AI-first pipeline does the heavy lifting. Uploads are auto-triaged: high-confidence → “Action Now,” else → “Re-check,” cutting manual review and letting admins dispatch crews faster with evidence they can trust. An active-learning loop lets admins’ decisions continuously improve the model and adapt to new spam patterns. Eliminates bias, errors, and delays caused by manual verification — ensuring fair recognition for all. Teachers and admins can easily monitor verified student activities through the dashboard. Encourages weekly or monthly volunteer drives, building a sustainable culture of community cleaning. The system connects citizens and institutions — everyone sees real impact and progress. Volunteers instantly receive acknowledgment for verified work.Admins can assign scores, badges, or certificates for consistent contributors.Recognition drives motivation — making cleanup a source of pride, not punishment. Every verified photo adds to a national map of environmental action. Helps track which areas are improving, polluted, or need attention — data for policy and awareness. Creates a shared digital story of impact — where individuals, schools, and communities are all visible contributors to a cleaner planet.

#### “Our AI empowers every citizen and student to fight climate change — by turning every verified cleanup photo into measurable action for a cleaner, greener, and happier planet.” 

Net result: phone-simple reporting, AI-authenticated proof, faster cleanups, actions and recognitions by community leaders, ensuring visible and motivated community momentum.

## Target Audience
1.	Citizens & Students (Primary Reporters) – Use their phones to snap and submit waste/dumping photos; get AI-verified badges, by admins through leaderboard rank that mirrors familiar social-media attention mechanics (recognition replaces likes/followers, motivating individuals).
2.	Teachers, Club Leaders & School Coordinators – Run weekly cleanup drives; rely on AI-authenticated photo attendance/proof, auto-compiled reports, and fair scoring to motivate sustained participation.
3.	Municipal Admins / City Operations – Receive an auto-triaged evidence queue (valid/re-check), hotspot maps, and action logs to dispatch crews faster, track SLAs, and allocate budgets efficiently.
4.	Enforcement Officers (Municipal/Police) – Access tamper-checked evidence bundles (time, location, duplicates) to act on illegal dumping with confidence and due process.
5.	Local Government Planners & Policy Makers – Use verified heatmaps and trend dashboards to plan bin placement, schedule patrols, and evaluate policy impact over time.

## Datasets
Balanced binary image set: dirty_places vs invalid. We curated positives from Kaggle’s TACO Trash (kneroma/tacotrashdataset), Clean/Dirty Road (faizalkarim/cleandirty-road-classification), and Clean/Dirty Garbage (mfadliramadhan/cleandirtygarbage). Negatives reflect real spam/noise using Meme Images (hammadjavaid/6992-labeled-meme-images-dataset), Animals-10 (alessiocorrado99/animals10), Icons-50 (danhendrycks/icons50), and Selfies (jigrubhatt/selfieimagedetectiondataset). All images were EXIF-corrected, resized to 224×224, and split train ~2.4k / val ~0.6k (near-balanced) for fast CPU training on IBM LinuxONE.

## Leveraging the IBM-Z technology to the solution:
IBM LinuxONE (IBM Z) provided an interactive, secure cloud console with robust compute and rich Python packages that simplified our workflow and sped up experimentation. In 24 hours we curated data, trained, and validated a validity classifier for community waste photos, reaching ~83% accuracy with dirty-class recall 0.89, supported by ROC/PR curves. LinuxONE’s stable CPUs, ample memory, and fast I/O let us iterate quickly and save reproducible artifacts (confusion matrix/ROC/PR/class metrics and metrics.json) to a shared path for the team. The platform also made it easy to integrate data sources, perform batch feature extraction, and keep an auditable record of runs—ideal for civic deployments. Next, we’ll use the same environment to add an active-learning loop (admin feedback → periodic retrain) and to harden thresholds for recall-first triage in production.
